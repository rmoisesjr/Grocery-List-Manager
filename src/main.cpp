// main.cpp flow:
// - Start by creating an instance of the collection you'll be working with.
// - Add a few pieces of data so you have something to experiment on.
// - Display everything so you confirm what is stored before making changes.
// - Try removing something that should exist and observe the updated result.
// - Then try removing something that clearly should NOT exist so you can see how your error handling behaves.
